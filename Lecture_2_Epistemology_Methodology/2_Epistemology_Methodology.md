## The Public Sphere

<split even>

![|x500](figures/Habermas.png)

![|x500](figures/McQuail.png)

</split>

<sub>after Habermas (2006), from Bruns (2008), from McQuail (2010) respectively</sub>

Note:
Habermas: centre-periphery structure around the political system, actors on virtual stage; speaking to a silent audience

Bruns: networked public sphere, mainstream 'mountain': large audience, low engagement, special interest slopes: small audiences, high engagement, individuals densely inter-connected by common interests however

McQuail: Development alongside media evolution: early mass media: unitary; multi-channel-media: pluralism; today: core-periphery model, diverse, but still connected; future: total disconnect; breakup-model 

---

![](figures/startrek1.png)

Note:
Some might say, this is a bad thing

---

![](figures/startrek2.png)

Note:
because if people don't talk to each other anymore and don't have common ground to do so, this leads to unresolvable conflicts

---

![](figures/startrek3.png)

Note:
So, if this dystopian vision by McQuail might be true, we should do something about it, or at least find out whether he's right

---

![](figures/startrek4.png)

Note:
And this is the point where this snippet from the Original Star Trek Series from the 60s is still _literally_ science fiction: we would not have anything such as a 'sociological computer' ‚Ä¶

---

![](figures/startrek5.png)

Note:
nor can we assume that any such thing might be able to solve a problem that is so human in its nature.

---

![100%](figures/thinking-face.png)

^However, if such a thing should ever exist, I'm sure it would make use of network science. I hope I can convince you with this talk, and perhaps with my thesis, that it will become, or should become, one of the most important auxiliary disciplines of media and communication studies, comparable to statistics.

---

# 2. Organised Complexity and Network Science

^
* Full overview not possible here
* thesis more comprehensive
* just try to make clear why it is so suited to these kind of problems

---

## Organised Complexity

Three eras in the history of science (Warren Weaver, 1948):

* simplicity: two variables -> simple calculus
* disorganised complexity: averages, distributions -> statistics
* organised complexity:

	> _This was a new science focused on problems where the identity of the elements involved in a system, and their patterns of interactions, could no longer be ignored. ‚Ä¶ a new math needed to emerge. (Hidalgo, 2016, p. 2)_

^
- simplicity: e.g. length of and force applied to a leaver
- disorganised complexity: audience size and ratings of a broadcast TV show
- from slide
- _I think the next century will be the century of complexity._ (Stephen Hawking)

---

## Network Science

Networks:

* ‚Äúmathematical objects that help us keep track of the identity of the elements involved in a system and their patterns of interaction‚Äù
* ‚Äúideal structures to describe problems of organized complexity‚Äù (Hidalgo, 2016, p. 2)

---

## Network Science

![inline fit](figures/Smith.png)


^
- possible, e.g., categorisation of smaller-scale communication patterns, and quantitative ways to measure these
- e.g. polarised crowd, broadcast networks
* allows to look at group or even society-wide patterns, while preserving complex properties of individuals

---

## Problem: Disciplinary Divide

![inline](figures/divide.pdf)

Problems in epistemology, methodology, teleology, education, and research training

^identified in thesis: not only education and training, but more important: differences in understanding of 'what you can know', 'how knowledge is gained', 'for what purpose we gain knowledge and why things happen'

---

# 3. Project Goal and Research Questions

---

## Project Goals

![inline  fit](figures/project goal.pdf)

^project's goals:
- improve ability of researchers from network science-related disciplines & media and communication studies to integrate each others work,
- dealing with big data on public communication.
- needs methodological framework -> major outcome of this work
- goals were also: exploration and development methods, to gather new empirical findings about public communication in a networked public sphere, and to scout new research opportunities and questions

---

## Research Question 1/3: How to Translate Theory?

How can we interpret established concepts and theories regarding public communication from the social sciences and media and communication studies as theories about the structural dynamics of networks?

^guided by three research questions

---

## Research Question 2/3: How to Apply Network Science?

How can we apply network science methods to analyse the structural dynamics of networks in online public communication on a scale of whole societies from a perspective that tries to build upon, reject, or extend traditional media and communication studies theory?

---

## Research Question 3/3: But Why?

Can this analysis be validated by its utility in confirming established theories or by leading to new theories about online public communication and the public sphere?

---


# [fit] Let's do this

^10 minutes

---

# 4. Methodological Framework

^
* underestimated its importance first
* first project started to make me question others, then my understanding of research, then my identity as a researcher/scientist
* actually developed alongside the studies and only started to make sense in the end
* became major outcome of this Project
* I see it as a fundamental necessity for the sustainable integration of network science into media and communication studies

---

## Methodological Framework


Synthesising ideas by

* Berry (2011) on the computational turn in the humanities;
* Halavais (2015) on Big Data interlinking the general with the particular;
* Sechrest & Sidani (1995) on a "false dichotomy" of qual vs quant
* Onwuegbuzie & Leech (2005) on pragmatism as a necessity;
* Dixon (2012) on an epistemology of patterns;


^
- Berry: computational methods became fundamental to concepts in the humanities
- Halavais: big data has potential to connect grand theory with everyday individual behaviour, allows to investigate influence of outliers, which are often driving change
- makes false dichotomy between qual and quant (as discussed by Sechrest & Sidani) more obvious
- and also the need for pragmatism, to disentangle epistemology from methodology
- furthermore, especially for network science: epistemology of patterns, patterns are not the result but a means, a method, vocabulary

---

![fit inline](figures/methodology_0.pdf)

^
- reflection on patterns opens possibility to integrate practices from the whole spectrum of academic research, as made necessary by the computational turn and big data

---

![fit inline](figures/methodology_1.pdf)

^
- if we recognise that one side of the spectrum tends to use more abductive reasoning, which is the formal way to refer to the hunches and guesses made in all disciplines to generate promising hypotheses
- and the other side lays a stronger focus on deduction/induction to catch up with shorter, what I call 'jumps over abductive gap'

---

![fit inline](figures/methodology_2.pdf)

^
- then patterns can be seen as a method/vocabulary
- heuristic for promising hypotheses based on human ability to spot them
- difference between disciplines lies in generalisability and timeliness that they aim for (explain)

---

![fit inline](figures/methodology_3.pdf)

^
- the deductive and inductive reasoning to catch up with the abductions is then done with more responsive (clinical aka qualitative) (better for exploration), or rule-based methods (formulaic aka quantitative) (better for replication for example), again with a preference depending on where in the spectrum a researcher is

--- 

![fit inline](figures/research cycle.png)

^In the end every academic practice is a cycle of abductive reasoning with patterns and inductive/deductive reasoning with more rule-based or responsive methods
In case of combining network science methods & media studies for this project:
- start with hypotheses
- find rule-based methods to test hypotheses
- leads to results that lead via inductive reasoning (repetition) to patterns
- abduction delivers new hypotheses
provides us, in a pragmatic worldview, with a scope to validate our methods by their usefulness to drive this research cycle.

---

# 5. Study 1: Measuring Communication Cascades

^
- went through cycle two times: acute events (information diffusion, virality), national public sphere (communities, audiences, publics)

---


## Cases

Three media items disseminated on Twitter, related to acute events:

* #sydneysiege ‚Äì most used
* #illridewithyou ‚Äì perceived as most 'viral'
* link to a petition to repeat the Brexit referendum ‚Äì interesting for comparison

^
- sydneysiege: terrorist attack sydney end of 2014, most popular hashtags
- illridewithyou: lead to islamophobic reactions, counterreaction as a hashtag offering support in public transport
- link to petition: petition website went down after result of Brexit referendum was announced
For all: shares on Twitter, and following networks by first 10,000 participating accounts collected

---

## What is virality (aka contagion)?

Three perspectives:

* virality of an item
* virality of the structure of a diffusion tree
* qualitative differences: simple (one exposure) vs. complex (threshold models) contagion


^leading goal: better understand notions of virality from a network perspective
- three selected

---

### Structural Virality (Avg. Shortest Path Length)

![inline fit](figures/structural property.png)

<sub>after Goel et al. (2015)</sub>

^
- Goel et al.: proposal structural virality measure: avg short. path length
- intuitively makes sense
- left: broadcast: avg. 2
- right: more 'viral': avg. higher than two

---

## Selected Results

---

### Connected Components

![inline](figures/illride.png)![](figures/siege.png)![](figures/brexit.png)

<sub>Diffusion trees reconstructed from __first 10,000 participating accounts__ in each case.</sub>

^from collected data:
- reconstructed diffusion network
- based on assumption that the last exposure triggered the reshare
- colour by connected component (meaning nodes being reachable from each other via the links have same colour)
- decreasing dominance of largest components
- increasing number of components
- equivalent to number of entry points -> more viral, more 'organic growth', less viral, more 'outside influence'
- in Brexit case explainable by the fact that a lot of shares might be simply triggered by a tweet button on the petition website

---

### Structural Virality (Avg. Shortest Path Length)

![inline](figures/ride 1.png)![](figures/siege 2.png)![](figures/brexit 2.png)

^
- again confirmation of intuition
- structural virality the highest for illridewithyou, the lowest for petition

---

### Influence Network

![inline fit](figures/ride 2.png)![fit](figures/siege 3.png)![fit](figures/brexit 3.png)


^
- influence network constructed in a way that if I followed another account + this account posted item before I did = connection
- gives up assumption of single exposure -> enables to analyse possible complex contagion
- hashtags both more clustered: more dense underlying community structure in form of follow connections

---

### Complexity of Contagion/Exposures per Friend (Followee)

![inline](figures/exposures_per_friend_illridewithyou.png)![](figures/exposures_per_friend_sydneysiege.png)![](figures/brexit_exp.png)

^
- the graphs show how the number of infections increases with the exposures to the respective item per friend
- could be understood as some form of 'peer pressure'
- average highest for illridewithyou (5 exposures per 100 friends)
- middle sydneysiege (3 exposures per 100 friends)
- far below for link (6 per 1000 friends)

---

### Summary of Results
|                          | #illridewithyou | #sydneysiege | petition |
|:-------------------------|:----------------|:-------------|:---------|
| outside influence        | +               | ++           | +++      |

| **complexity of contagion**  | +++             | ++           | +        |

<sub>\*see thesis</sub>

^
- summary: all results point to higher virality
- except: higher complexity for illridewithyou appears counterintuitive first
- in fact:  underlines together with clustering importance of underlying structures of attention

---

## Application to Theory (example): Gatekeeping

^(besides clarifiying concepts of virality) closes circle to theory by providing base for thoughts on an extension of concept of gatekeeping

---

![fit](figures/distributed_gatekeeping.pdf)

^
- based on this and literature, propose a concept of distributed gatekeeping in networks, based on limited attention space
- very limited example here, but good to get the idea, links symbolise long-term attention
- let's say general average threshold of 2 to reshare an item

---

![fit](figures/distributed_gatekeeping_1.pdf)

^
- this node, acts as a quasi-gatekeeper gets the message through to the target
- important observation: based on properties of node (lower threshold), but also on position in the network (node on the far right would not have had success)
- we can see that underlying, long-term network structure is important at small scales
- also possible to see the nodes as groups of nodes -> leads us to consider large-scale communication structures, thereby to next study

---

# 6. Study 2: Mappings of a Public Sphere

^20 minutes

---

## 4 kinds of maps from 2 perspectives

* force directed network maps
* keyword mappings
* adjacency maps
* treemaps

mapping the Australian Twittersphere (follow-network) based on results from 2 different community detection approaches

---

## Part 1: The Quasi-Standard ‚Äì Communities Based on Inner Density (Modularity Maximisation)

---

![inline fit original](figures/bruns_map.png)

![right fit original](figures/new result.png)

<sub>__left (Bruns et al., 2017):__ Australian follow network filtered for __accounts with over 1000 followees + followers__. Labels based on **close reading of profile descriptions**</sub>

<sub>__right (this project):__ community graph of communities with degree > 10,000, based on modularity maximisation for the __full Australian follow network__ (> 2 million accounts). Labels based on **keyword extraction from tweets by 10% of accounts from each community**</sub>

^
- left: visualisation of Australian Twitter follow network, filtered
- the denser connected nodes are, the closer together
- emerging clusters of high density
- labels: close reading 100 profile descriptions per cluster
- right: faster algorithm for community detection based on same principle
- unfiltered
- community graph of best-connected and largest communities
- labels: automatic keyword detection
- shows similar, almost same structures, e.g. porn, teens, hard-right, politics -> validates community detection and labelling method for later use

---

### Keyword Maps

* based on tweets by accounts in community-cores (containing ca. 10% of respective community) from 10-19 February 2017
* done for 53 communities containing over 1000 accounts

^
- automatic keyword extraction enabled deeper dive into topical connections
- following figures done for all 53 communities with more than 1000 accounts, will be available online, exemplifying analysis here with only two communities

---

![fit](figures/auspol.png)![fit](figures/hard-right.png)

^
- left side of each figure: most distinct 60 keywords and the fraction of accounts having used them in the community core in focus
- right side of each figure: heatmap showing keyword use in all other communities

---

![fit](figures/keywords_auspol.pdf)![fit](figures/hard-right.png)

^
- left side Australian politics, as easy to see by the keywords extracted

---

![fit](figures/keywords_auspol.pdf)![fit](figures/keywords_hard_right.pdf)

^
- right: hard-right politics cluster
- keywords as easy to interpret as this for almost all other communities as well

---

![fit](figures/auspol_labelled.png)![fit](figures/hard-right_labelled.png)

^
- clearly visible: one-way relationship regarding topical keywords
- hard-right uses keywords from politics, but not the other way round
- single keywords related to Islam and migrants make it into mainstream discussion
- critique of Islam and immigration as tactical spearhead to enter mainstream discussion

---

### Adjacency Map

^
- connection between hard-right and politics also visible in another explored possibility to visualise a network
- more common in natural sciences

---

![fit](figures/adj_PLM.png)

^
- shows how strongly connected communities are, the lighter the better
- examples: pop culture: with music, and TV shows; politics through whole network; hard right: high inner density, strongly connected with politics
- advantages: better overview over connections, example LGBTIQ
- visible: density approach of modularity maximisation

---

### Epistemological Implications

#### modularity maximisation <-> echo chamber

"Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules." (Wikipedia, "Modularity (networks)", 11.3.2018)

‚ÄúAn echo chamber comes into being where a group of participants _choose to preferentially connect_ with each other, to the exclusion of outsiders.‚Äù (Bruns, 2017)

^subtle problem if for example trying to address the concept of echo chambers and filter bubbles: underlying definition of community with the used detection method is equivalent to echo chamber definition by Bruns

---

### Epistemological Implications

* actually echo-chamber detection method (-)
* resolution limit: either might split up large communities, or ignore small communities (-)
* no statistical tests to distinguish noise from structure, danger of detecting patterns that are not there (apophenia) (-)
* pattern is known, easy to interpret (+)
* efficient (+)

---

## Part 2: Test of Alternative Community Detection Approach

---

#### Nested Stochastic Block Model (SBM) Inference

![right fit](figures/SBM.png)

* SBM inference does not look for specific patterns (+-)
* grouping nodes with similar 'roles', i.e. connection patterns (e.g., periphery, centre, bridge, echo chamber) (+)
* hierarchical: circumvents resolution limit (+)
* safeguarded from spotting patterns that are not there (apophenia) (+)
* patterns unknown, analysis after detection, harder to interpret (-)

## Results

---

![fit](figures/globe.png)![fit](figures/adj matrix.png)

^
- filtered network > 1000, follow network, hierarchical network visualisation
- left: explain levels, edges bundled by source and destination
- labels based on same keyword detection method as before, however with tweets by all accounts
- go quickly through tree
- right: visualises grouping on level 1 with adjacency matrix, as above
- hierarchy visible, larger blocks containing smaller blocks with similar connection patterns 
- teens also here separate
- only block spanning all seems to be entertainment
- light diagonal represents some justification to use density as heuristic

---

### Treemaps

### hierarchical visualisation of keywords used by accounts in blocks on every level

---

^size of blocks represents active accounts, keywords used by at least 5% of active accounts in block 
see divide periphery, centre, dominance of auspol

---

![fit](figures/medium level.png)

^teenage cluster, politics, sports

---

![fit](figures/treemap_2.png)![fit](figures/treemap_1.png)

^Treemaps:
- even more detail on level 2
- right on the more detailed level 1
- examples level 2: porn, teens, startups, politics, focus on sports
- example level 1: sports now divided into different forms of sport (cricket and Rugby)

---

![fit](figures/sports lowest level.png)

^
- most detailed level, zoomed in on sports
- now visible special interests such as golf, track athletics, or european soccer

---

## Application to Theory (example): Networked Public Sphere

^To close the circle: one of more examples in my thesis of use for theory based on strong empirical evidence

---

![fit](figures/Bruns 1.png)![fit](figures/level 3.png)![fit](figures/net_level_2.png)

^
besides the Epistemological implications discussed before:
- possible to revisit and extend theories about a networked public sphere
- left: block-graph from level 3, reminiscent of mainstream mountain and special interest slopes
- issue-publics and smaller communities become visible on right, level 2
- We see that hierarchical algorithms make it possible to investigate theories about a networked public sphere with different forms of publics on different macro-, meso-, and micro-scales
- closer inspection of connections of these communities and the topics that they talk about over time will help assessing and developing theories about the networked public sphere

---

# 7. Discussion

![left fit](figures/research cycle.png)

^let's reflect a bit on what happened after having gone sucessfully through the cycle 2 times

---

## What is it good for? (Contribution to Knowledge)


![inline fit original](figures/contrib_1.pdf)

^
- actually too many empirical results even for the analysis in the thesis
- 1. study: insights about virality of the events and identified important actors
- 2. study: detailed overview of the Australian Twittersphere and association of all accounts with communities for further analysis
- exemplified some of the opportunities to validate and extend theory

---

## What is it good for? (Contribution to Knowledge)


![inline fit original](figures/contrib_2.pdf)

^
- longer term outcome, and actual aim of project: methods and procedures
- for example: enable us to categorise hashtags by their virality, or inspect evolution of topics in the Australian Twittersphere over time

---

## What is it good for? (Contribution to Knowledge)


![inline fit original](figures/contrib_3.pdf)

^
- not aimed for first, but most fundamental: outlined methodological Framework
- hopefully enables, when further developed, interdisciplinary researchers or teams to overcome disciplinary divides

---

## RQ1: How To Translate theory?

^finally, let's come back to answers to the research questions
How to translate theory?

---

* mostly straightforward: model entities as nodes, interactions as edges(, context as layers), or semantically: subjects/nouns as actors, actions/verbs as links
* but: good background knowledge about network analysis methods as well as theories needed to construct useful models
* especially suitable for theories about interaction patterns between individuals/entities, e.g., information diffusion, audience behaviour, publics, and communities
* less suitable for theories that deal with phenomena beyond observable interactions, e.g., media effects

^28

---

## RQ2: How To Apply Network Science?

---

* methodological (i.e. epistemology + teleology) framework needed for sustainable integration of methods and theory
* 'rule-based' researchers:
	- dare to 'jump over the abductive gap', interpret results
	- understand context
* 'responsive' researchers:
	- true understanding, not only application, of rule-based methods as providers of patterns
	- math and programming skills highly recommended

---

Practical steps (variations possible):

1. Translating theory;
2. model and collect data;
3. exploration (visualisation);
4. verification (measuring/content analysis);
5. validation with (mathematical/agent-based) models and/or theory;
6. revise theory, rinse, repeat

^29

---

## RQ3: But why?

* Network science is able to generate, and detect, patterns that can drive the abductive generation, and the inductive/deductive verification of hypotheses central to theory about public communication, especially on a society-wide scale.
* Network science is particularly important for dealing with problems of organised complexity.
* Public communication faces society-wide challenges (hate-speech, extremism, fake news, ‚Ä¶) due to the increased structural/organised complexity of a networked public sphere.
